Angular connection with Dropbox API; DropboxChooser Directive


## What's to come
The "plan" is to create an angular version of Dropbox's API. For now though, I'm starting with an [AngularJS directive for the DropboxChooser](dropboxchooser-directive).  

Here's [Dropbox's documentation on the Dropbox Chooser](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/chooser).  
`NOTE:` read [the Angular directive for DropboxChooser README.md](dropboxchooser-directive/README.md) for thinking you can do everything their documentation says ;)
